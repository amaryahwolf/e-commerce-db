## Installation
To install the application locally, ensure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed, then clone the repository from Github. Connect a [MySQL workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) to the application through the config/connection.js file, then create the database in the workbench using the schema in the db folder. Seed the data by running the seed script ```npm run seed``` and finally start the server by running the start script ```npm run start```.

## Usage
To explore the database, use a REST client such as Insomnia or Postman to view, test and validate CRUD routes. Check out this [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qi6dp7nd0x2Q0hXeTUTCzd-HTvnh_zfM/view) walkthrough to learn more about the application!
